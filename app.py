                            and years. Unrest Severity captures the fatality and peacefulness of protests in a country-year and Unrest Intensity represents the number of 
                            days of protest in a year. A high Unrest Severity value indicates that the events in the country-year were more violent than peaceful and saw a lot of fatalities
                            and a low Unrest Severity value implies that events in the country-year were more peaceful than violent and saw a relatively low number of fatilites.
